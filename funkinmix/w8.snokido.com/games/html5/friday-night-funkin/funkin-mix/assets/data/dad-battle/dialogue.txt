:dad:sullen:Alright, cut the bullshit.
:dad:serious4:What's the actual reason you two have been meeting up?
:gf:afraid2:...
:bf:concerned:You see, sir...
:bf:thinking:Your daughter wanted me to help her convince you that she's cut out for the business.
:bf:awkward:So we've been meeting up doing little training sessions!
:dad:serious:...What kind of training?
:bf:awkward:Uh... like shooting?
:sound:gun:BANG!
:bf:afraid:S-sir???
:gf:afraid:Daddy, why did you try to shoot him?!
:gf:sweat:And why do you even have a gun?!
:aside: :(Daddy stares down BF menacingly, with a look that could kill.)
:dad:serious4:Gah, you think you're hot stuff? Even dodging my bullet.
:dad:sullen:Well, if you can beat me here...
:dad:threatening:Only then will I even CONSIDER letting you date my daughter and have her become a part of this business, boy.
:bf:afraid4:-gulp-
