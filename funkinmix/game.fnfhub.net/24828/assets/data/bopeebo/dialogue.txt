:bf:happy:Girlfriend! Hey!
:gf:happy2:Boyfriend! You made it!
:bf:happy:Yeah, think your dad is in a good mood lately.
:bf:thinking:Considering he didn't question why I needed to go this time. (I wonder why...)
:bf:shy2:I gotta go back afterwards though, so I hope you don't mind us doing this a bit shorter.
:gf:normal:That's totally fine!
:gf:happy:Well, are you ready?
:bf:happy2:Totally, babe.
:gf:happy2:Hehe, alright! Let's start the music-

:dad:serious:So, this was that "urgent" thing, boy?
:dad:sullen:You both got some explaining to do.
:dad:serious4:Now.
:bf:afraid2:W-well... um-
:dad:well2:He didn't do anything to you, did he, sweetie?
:dad:serious4:I'm ready to fire him right now if he did.
:bf:afraid3:What- hey!
:gf:angry2:No, he didn't do anything to me!
:gf:sweat:We've just been...
:gf:awkward3:meeting up... with each other.
:dad:serious4:And for what reason are you two doing so?
:gf:sweat:W-well...
:gf:awkward3:B-because...
:gf:awkward4:Because we're...
:bf:shy3:I'm dating your daughter... and another reason... sir.

:dad:unhurried:So, this is where you've been running to this entire time?
:dad:angry2:Seeing my daughter behind my back, boy?
:bf:afraid2:W-we've just been singing sir!
:dad:sigh:Hah! You think you can just sing with my daughter like that?
:dad:threatening:If you want to date her...
:aside: :(BF shuts his eyes, anticipating what his boss will do to him now.)
:bf:eye-closed:...
:dad:normal:You're going to have to go through ME first!
:bf:confused:Wha-
:bf:afraid2:A microphone? I thought you were going to-
:dad:displeased:Well, I still haven't heard your "other reason" for meeting up with my daughter.
:bf:concerned:...So, you sing?
:dad:confident:It runs in the family.
:dad:threatening:Guess I'll show you what happens when you underestimate me, boy.
