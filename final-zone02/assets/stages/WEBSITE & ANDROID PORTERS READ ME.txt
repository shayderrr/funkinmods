Hi, I'm Snow.

--If you're a website trying to port my mod so you can fill it with ads:

don't.
You've done this to me three times and each time you've done it.
I've stated my disapproval, and yet you've somehow fucked it up each time.
You **DO NOT** have my permission to reupload this mod onto any site, or download.
Credit is not enough, you're profiting off me.
Fuck off.

Extra sidenote btw, the whole mod will likely run like garbage on html5 anyway.
but you don't care about that do you
you just want money, lol.

--Meanwhile, Android people:

Hey guys, you lot aint that bad cuz you ain't blatantly slapping ads all over.
Plus i do find it kinda cool how my bad code can run on phones so you guys are aight. respect.

But a heads up; this mod is made strictly for PCs in mind.
Porting it over may not work very well, due to some scripts n' shit making videos render mid-song.
If it works, good on you guys ig lol. Just tell people where they can download the original, cool? Cool.
